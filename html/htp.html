                Rules are simple: choose a gamemode you want to play and press <b>'Start'</b>. Each gamemode has its own unique rules.<br><br>
                <strong>Basic gameplay rules:</strong><br>
                - Use <b>'A'</b> and <b>'D'</b> buttons to move left and right<br>
                - Press <b>'Space'</b> to shoot arrows at the enemies<br><br>
                <strong>Standard:</strong><br>
                This is the standard, 1 minute long game mode. All you have to do here is score as many points as possible in one minute. 
                <b>Be careful though...</b> As the time passes by, <b>'Phantoms'</b> get more aggressive!<br><br>
                <strong>Wave survival:</strong><br>
                In this gamemode, you are in <b>'The Nether'</b> fighting <b>'Ghasts'</b>. Survive as many waves as possible.
