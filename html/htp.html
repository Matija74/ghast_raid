                Welcome to Ghast Raid!<br><br>
                Your goal is to survive waves of enemies and score as many points as you can.<br>
                - Use 'A' and 'D' keys to move.<br>
                - Press 'SPACE' to shoot.<br>
                - Each ghast you hit gives you 10 points. <br>
                - For every missed shot you lose 2 points.<br>
                - Every ghast that makes it past you takes away 5 points.<br><br>
                Good luck, warrior!
